# prettier-restart-plugin-
Well, this is my first enmity plugin, it’s not a very useful plugin, it’s basically just a dialog box which asks you, if you want to restart your discord client.

# requirements
Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download)

~~a node compatible IDE of your choice (e.g Visual Studio Code)~~
a IDE with a terminal or just your normal system terminal

# build the plugin
use these commands in a terminal (be sure to cd to the path of the project)

npm i

npm run build

now there should be a folder called "dist", in this folder is the plugin.\

# How to use 
go to any channel, where you have send message permissions, then type "/restart" and choose my command and execute it
